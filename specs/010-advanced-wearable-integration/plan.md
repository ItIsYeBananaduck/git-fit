**Critical Dependencies**:
- Advanced health metrics must integrate with existing AI training engine
- Multi-device data must maintain quality standards for workout adjustments
- All integrations must preserve existing Fitbit/WHOOP functionality
- Real-time data flow must maintain <5-second latency requirements

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md with multi-device priority)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (comprehensive testing, device compatibility, performance validation)
