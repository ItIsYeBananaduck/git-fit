# Feature Specification: Advanced Wearable Integration

**Feature Branch**: `010-advanced-wearable-integration`
**Created**: September 29, 2025
**Status**: Active
**Priority**: High - Core feature for AI-driven workout optimization
**Extends**: specs/001-technically-fit/spec.md (FR-002, FR-003)

## Overview

Comprehensive wearable device integration system that provides real-time health and fitness data collection from multiple device manufacturers. Builds upon the basic wearable requirements in the main specification to provide robust device management, data quality monitoring, offline synchronization, and advanced health metrics for AI-driven workout optimization.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A pro user connects their Apple Watch, WHOOP strap, and Fitbit scale to Adaptive fIt for comprehensive health monitoring. During workouts, the system collects real-time heart rate, blood oxygen, heart rate variability, and stress indicators to provide intelligent workout adjustments. When devices disconnect or provide conflicting data, the system seamlessly manages fallbacks and reconnections while maintaining data quality for AI recommendations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user with multiple wearable devices, **When** they complete device setup, **Then** all devices sync data automatically with conflict resolution and data quality scoring.

2. **Given** a user's Apple Watch disconnects during a workout, **When** the connection is lost, **Then** the system switches to manual input mode and automatically reconnects when the device is available.

3. **Given** conflicting heart rate data from multiple devices, **When** data synchronization occurs, **Then** the system prioritizes the most accurate device based on historical quality scores and user preferences.

4. **Given** a user with a WHOOP device, **When** they wake up, **Then** the system automatically imports sleep data, HRV metrics, and recovery scores to adjust the day's workout intensity.

5. **Given** a user exercises without internet connection, **When** they return online, **Then** all cached wearable data synchronizes automatically with timestamp preservation and conflict resolution.

### Edge Cases

- Multiple devices providing conflicting data simultaneously
- Device battery death during critical workout moments
- Network interruptions during data synchronization
- Device firmware updates affecting data formats
- User switches between different device brands
- Temporary device malfunction or sensor errors

## Business Rules

### Device Priority & Selection

1. **Primary Device Rule**: User-designated primary device takes precedence for workout adjustments
2. **Quality-Based Selection**: Highest quality score wins conflicts when no primary device specified
3. **Real-Time Priority**: Real-time capable devices preferred for workout adjustments
4. **Backup Device Logic**: Secondary devices activated when primary device disconnects

### Data Quality Standards

1. **Heart Rate Validation**: Values outside 40-220 BPM flagged for review
2. **SpO2 Validation**: Values below 85% or above 100% require confirmation
3. **HRV Validation**: Values outside 10-200ms flagged as potential errors
4. **Cross-Device Tolerance**: 10% variance between devices considered normal

### Workout Adjustment Triggers

1. **Heart Rate Thresholds**: >150 BPM triggers rest extension, >180 BPM triggers intensity reduction
2. **SpO2 Thresholds**: <95% triggers intensity reduction, <90% triggers workout pause
3. **HRV Declines**: >30% drop from baseline suggests overtraining risk
4. **Stress Indicators**: Elevated stress scores modify intensity recommendations
