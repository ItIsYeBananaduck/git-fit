# Feature Specification: Performance Analytics & Monitoring

**Feature Branch**: `009-performance-analytics-monitoring`
**Created**: September 29, 2025
**Status**: Active
**Priority**: High - Essential for business intelligence and system optimization

## Overview

Comprehensive analytics and monitoring platform that tracks user behavior, AI effectiveness, system performance, and business metrics. Provides real-time dashboards for executives, coaches, and administrators while maintaining user privacy and generating actionable insights for product improvement and business growth.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

Product managers and executives use comprehensive analytics dashboards to monitor user engagement, AI recommendation effectiveness, revenue metrics, and system health. Coaches access performance insights about their clients, while administrators monitor technical metrics and troubleshoot issues. The system provides real-time alerts for critical issues and automated reports for business decision-making.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an executive viewing the dashboard, **When** they select the last 30 days, **Then** they see user acquisition, retention, revenue, and feature usage metrics with trend analysis.

2. **Given** an AI model performance alert, **When** recommendation accuracy drops below 75%, **Then** the system automatically notifies the AI team and suggests model retraining.

3. **Given** a coach monitoring client progress, **When** they view client analytics, **Then** they see workout completion rates, goal progress, and AI recommendation effectiveness without accessing personal data.

4. **Given** a system performance issue, **When** API response times exceed 2 seconds, **Then** automated alerts are triggered and incident response procedures are initiated.

5. **Given** a business analyst preparing monthly reports, **When** they export analytics data, **Then** they receive comprehensive business intelligence reports with privacy-compliant user insights.

### Edge Cases

- Analytics during system outages or partial failures
- Privacy-compliant reporting for users who withdrew consent
- Real-time analytics during high-traffic periods (product launches)
- Cross-platform analytics reconciliation (iOS vs Android vs Web)
- Historical data analysis when retention policies delete detailed records
