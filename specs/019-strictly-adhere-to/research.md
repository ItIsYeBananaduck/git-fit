# Research: Strictly adhere to the project constitution and implement all 15 tasks

All technical unknowns were resolved during clarification phase. No additional research required.

- Decision: Use Capacitor plugin with llama.cpp for Llama 3.1 integration
- Rationale: Local inference on mobile devices for privacy and performance
- Alternatives considered: Cloud-based Llama API (rejected due to latency and cost)

- Decision: Target iPhone 7 and Android API 19 as low-end devices
- Rationale: Ensures support for older devices with canvas fallbacks
- Alternatives considered: Newer devices only (rejected due to user base inclusivity)

- Decision: CSV columns for Task 15: exercise,sets,reps,weight,rest
- Rationale: Standard strength training data format
- Alternatives considered: Additional columns like time (rejected as unnecessary)

- Decision: Accessory schema for Task 2: type, color, position, style
- Rationale: Flexible for future extensions
- Alternatives considered: Fixed accessories (rejected for extensibility)

- Decision: Performance targets: latency <500ms, animations 30 FPS
- Rationale: Ensures smooth user experience on low-end devices
- Alternatives considered: Higher targets (rejected for device constraints)
