## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a fitness app user, I want the AI coach (Alice/Aiden) to continuously improve based on community workout data and provide personalized voice feedback during workouts, so that I receive increasingly accurate and motivating guidance that feels natural and responsive to my training patterns.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a premium user starting a workout, **When** I complete a set with high strain, **Then** Alice provides encouraging voice feedback that matches the intensity context
2. **Given** the system has collected a week's worth of anonymized user logs, **When** the weekly training cycle runs, **Then** the AI model is updated with new patterns and insights
3. **Given** I have earbuds connected and voice feedback enabled, **When** Alice speaks, **Then** I hear audio that sounds natural and contextually appropriate (whisper for high strain, excited for PRs)
4. **Given** I have used the app multiple times, **When** Alice speaks the same phrase again, **Then** the audio plays instantly from cache without delay
5. **Given** I am a non-premium user, **When** I use the app, **Then** I receive text-based AI feedback but no voice synthesis

### Edge Cases
- What happens when voice synthesis fails or network is unavailable?
- How does system handle users who opt out of anonymous data collection?
- What occurs when AI training job fails or Hugging Face is unavailable?
- How does voice caching behave when storage limits are reached?
- What happens when user disconnects earbuds mid-workout?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### AI Training Pipeline
- **FR-001**: System MUST collect anonymized workout logs weekly from all consenting users
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically retrain AI model using collected data every Sunday at 2 AM UTC
- **FR-003**: System MUST anonymize all personal data before training (hash user IDs, remove identifying information)
- **FR-004**: Training pipeline MUST update the live AI model only after successful validation
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain backup of previous AI model version for rollback capability
- **FR-024**: System MUST retry failed training jobs up to 5 times before falling back to backup model
- **FR-026**: System MUST handle training datasets scaling up to 50GB for 50K active users

#### Voice Integration & Synthesis
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide voice synthesis for premium users only
- **FR-007**: System MUST clone user's preferred AI voice personality on first setup
- **FR-008**: System MUST cache generated voice clips to minimize API costs and improve response time
- **FR-009**: System MUST adapt voice tone based on workout context (whisper for high strain, excited for achievements)
- **FR-010**: System MUST detect audio output device and only provide voice when earbuds/headphones are connected

#### User Experience & Privacy
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to opt out of anonymous data collection for AI training
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to toggle voice feedback on/off in settings
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide clear visual feedback when AI is speaking (sound wave animation)
- **FR-014**: System MUST show toast notifications for AI responses even when voice is disabled
- **FR-015**: System MUST delete user data within 30 days upon request
- **FR-027**: System MUST provide visual sound wave indicators and haptic feedback for users with hearing impairments

#### Performance & Scalability
- **FR-016**: Voice clips MUST play within 500ms for cached content
- **FR-017**: System MUST maintain sub-500ms response time for AI interactions at 10k+ concurrent users
- **FR-018**: Voice cache MUST store last 10 unique clips per user and rotate randomly when full
- **FR-019**: System MUST gracefully degrade to text-only mode when voice services are unavailable
- **FR-025**: Voice synthesis service MUST maintain 99.5% uptime (maximum 43.8 hours downtime per year)

#### Security & Compliance
- **FR-020**: System MUST encrypt all trainer payment communications
- **FR-021**: System MUST store anonymized training data for maximum 6 months
- **FR-022**: System MUST provide complete data deletion within 30 days of user request
- **FR-023**: Voice synthesis MUST only activate for verified premium users

### Key Entities

- **Training Data**: Anonymized workout logs including exercise type, set number, strain percentage, skip reasons, sleep hours, and AI responses used for model improvement
- **Voice Cache**: Stored audio clips mapped to specific text phrases with metadata for tone, context, and expiration
- **AI Model Version**: Versioned AI model weights and configurations with rollback capability and performance metrics
- **User Voice Preferences**: Premium user settings for voice personality (Alice/Aiden), tone preferences, and voice on/off toggle
- **Training Session**: Weekly automated process including data collection, model training, validation, and deployment stages
