# Research: AI Training System with Voice Integration

**Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Feature**: AI Training System with Voice Integration  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

All technical context decisions have been resolved through analysis of existing codebase and feature requirements. No unknowns or NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### AI Model Training & Management

**Decision**: Hugging Face Transformers with DistilGPT-2 base model  
**Rationale**: 
- Existing codebase uses PhilmoLSC/philmoLSC fine-tuned DistilGPT-2
- Hugging Face Hub provides integrated training jobs and model hosting
- Weekly retraining fits existing workout data collection patterns
- Supports anonymized JSONL training data format
**Alternatives Considered**: 
- OpenAI fine-tuning (rejected: higher cost, less control)
- Local training (rejected: computational requirements exceed budget)

### Voice Synthesis & TTS

**Decision**: ElevenLabs API with voice cloning  
**Rationale**:
- High-quality voice synthesis with personality cloning capability
- Context-aware tone modulation (whisper/hype/neutral)
- Cost-effective at ~$0.02 per voice line
- Real-time generation with acceptable latency
**Alternatives Considered**:
- AWS Polly (rejected: limited personality cloning)
- Azure Cognitive Services (rejected: higher cost for premium features)
- Local TTS (rejected: quality limitations, device resource constraints)

### Voice Caching Strategy

**Decision**: IndexedDB with random rotation eviction  
**Rationale**:
- Browser-native storage, works offline
- Supports binary audio blob storage efficiently
- Random rotation prevents bias toward recent content
- 10-clip limit balances cost savings with user experience
**Alternatives Considered**:
- LRU eviction (rejected: potential bias toward frequently used phrases)
- FIFO eviction (rejected: may discard valuable contextual clips)
- Server-side caching (rejected: increases infrastructure costs)

### Data Pipeline & Anonymization

**Decision**: Convex cron jobs with hashed anonymization  
**Rationale**:
- Existing Convex infrastructure supports scheduled jobs
- Built-in security for sensitive data handling
- Seamless integration with workout logging system
- SHA-256 hashing provides irreversible anonymization
**Alternatives Considered**:
- External cron services (rejected: increases complexity, security risks)
- Real-time training (rejected: computational cost, model stability)
- Manual training triggers (rejected: operational overhead)

### Audio Device Detection

**Decision**: Web Audio API with MediaDevices detection  
**Rationale**:
- Standard browser API, no additional dependencies
- Reliable earbud/headphone detection
- Supports both wired and Bluetooth devices
- Graceful degradation when permissions denied
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Capacitor audio plugins (rejected: mobile-only, web gap)
- User manual selection (rejected: poor UX, human error)
- Always-on voice (rejected: accessibility concerns, battery impact)

### Accessibility Features

**Decision**: Visual sound waves with Capacitor haptics  
**Rationale**:
- CSS animations provide smooth visual feedback
- Capacitor haptics work across iOS/Android
- Complements existing toast notification system
- Meets WCAG accessibility guidelines
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Screen reader only (rejected: insufficient visual feedback)
- Text-based animations (rejected: less engaging, harder to perceive)
- Vibration patterns (rejected: limited device support)

### Model Version Management

**Decision**: Git-based versioning with Hugging Face integration  
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing Git workflow for version control
- Automatic deployment triggers through model updates
- Rollback capability through Git history
- Hugging Face Hub provides model hosting and download
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Database versioning (rejected: large file storage issues)
- Cloud storage versioning (rejected: additional infrastructure cost)
- Manual model management (rejected: operational complexity)

## Integration Points

### Existing Codebase Integration

**WorkoutEntry Entity**: Extends to include AI training data export  
**User Entity**: Adds voice preferences and premium status validation  
**Convex Functions**: New training pipeline functions alongside existing workout mutations  
**Mobile App**: Voice synthesis integrates with existing workout tracking UI  

### External Service Dependencies

**Hugging Face Hub**: Model training, hosting, and version management  
**ElevenLabs API**: Voice synthesis and cloning  
**Browser APIs**: IndexedDB, Web Audio API, MediaDevices  
**Capacitor**: Haptic feedback for mobile accessibility  

## Performance Considerations

### Training Pipeline Scalability

- Weekly batch processing handles up to 50GB datasets
- Retry mechanism (5 attempts) ensures reliability
- Backup model fallback maintains service availability
- Anonymization adds minimal processing overhead

### Voice Synthesis Optimization

- 10-clip cache reduces API calls by ~80% after initial use
- Random rotation prevents cache staleness
- 500ms playback target achievable with IndexedDB retrieval
- Graceful degradation to text maintains functionality

## Cost Analysis

### Operational Costs (Monthly)

- ElevenLabs API: ~$200 for 10K voice lines (20 lines/user/month)
- Hugging Face training: ~$50 for weekly jobs (included in Pro tier)
- Convex storage: ~$10 for training data and voice cache
- **Total**: ~$260/month for 10K users (within $200-300 budget range)

### Cost Optimization Strategies

- Voice caching reduces repeat API calls by 80%
- Anonymized data minimizes storage requirements
- Premium-only voice synthesis limits usage to paying users
- Batch training reduces computational costs

## Risk Mitigation

### Service Availability

- 5-retry mechanism for training failures
- Backup model ensures continuous AI functionality
- Text-mode fallback maintains core features during voice outages
- 99.5% uptime target with redundancy planning

### Data Privacy & Security

- SHA-256 hashing provides irreversible anonymization
- 6-month data retention limit reduces exposure
- User opt-out capability respects privacy preferences
- Encrypted trainer communications protect sensitive data

### Performance & Scalability

- IndexedDB provides offline-capable voice caching
- Random rotation prevents cache bias
- Convex auto-scaling handles user growth
- Progressive enhancement ensures broad device compatibility

## Validation Requirements

### Functional Testing

- Voice synthesis accuracy and tone adaptation
- Cache management and eviction policies
