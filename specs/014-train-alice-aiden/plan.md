# Implementation Plan: AI Training System with Voice Integration

**Branch**: `014-train-alice-aiden` | **Date**: September 30, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/014-train-alice-aiden/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Automated AI training pipeline that retrains Alice/Aiden model weekly using anonymized user workout logs, combined with premium voice synthesis featuring ElevenLabs TTS, voice caching, context-aware tone adaptation, and comprehensive accessibility support for hearing-impaired users.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, JavaScript ES2022, Python 3.10+  
**Primary Dependencies**: SvelteKit 2.22+, Convex 1.27+, Hugging Face Transformers, ElevenLabs API  
**Storage**: Convex real-time database, IndexedDB (voice cache), Hugging Face Hub  
**Testing**: Vitest 3.2+, Convex testing framework  
**Target Platform**: Web (SvelteKit), Capacitor mobile apps, Convex serverless backend  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms voice playback, <200ms AI response, 99.5% voice uptime  
**Constraints**: $0.02/voice-line cost, 10-clip cache limit, 50GB training datasets

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend SvelteKit app with Convex backend for AI training pipeline and voice synthesis

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✅
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

**Status**: Complete  
**Completed**: September 30, 2025

### Completed Tasks:

1. **✅ Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships: 2 extended entities (User, WorkoutEntry), 6 new entities
   - Validation rules from requirements: Constitutional compliance, privacy protection
   - State transitions if applicable: Training pipeline, voice cache lifecycle

2. **✅ Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint: AI training and voice synthesis APIs
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns: OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`: 2 complete API specifications

3. **✅ Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint: ai-training-api.test.ts, voice-synthesis-api.test.ts
   - Assert request/response schemas: Comprehensive test coverage
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet): ✅ Intentionally failing for TDD

4. **✅ Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario: 5 detailed scenarios in quickstart.md
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps: Complete with performance targets

5. **✅ Update agent file incrementally** (Complete):
   - Ran `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
   - Added new tech stack to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
   - Preserved manual additions, updated recent changes

### Artifacts Generated:

#### Data Model Design
- **File**: `data-model.md` (219 lines)
- **Content**: Complete entity definitions with extended User/WorkoutEntry entities and 6 new entities
- **Entities**: AITrainingData, VoiceCache, VoicePreferences, AIModel, TrainingSession, VoiceInteraction
- **Features**: Anonymization, voice caching, training pipeline, constitutional compliance

#### API Contracts
- **Files**: 
  - `contracts/ai-training-api.openapi.yaml` (574 lines) - AI training and model management
  - `contracts/voice-synthesis-api.openapi.yaml` (687 lines) - Voice synthesis and cache management
- **Coverage**: 15 endpoints total with comprehensive request/response schemas
- **Validation**: Complete error handling, rate limiting, premium user verification

#### Contract Tests (TDD Approach)
- **Files**:
  - `contracts/ai-training-api.test.ts` (382 lines) - 25 failing tests for AI training
  - `contracts/voice-synthesis-api.test.ts` (567 lines) - 30 failing tests for voice synthesis
- **Coverage**: Happy paths, error cases, validation, constitutional compliance, performance
- **Status**: Intentionally failing to drive implementation (TDD approach)

#### Integration Guide
- **File**: `quickstart.md` (570 lines)
- **Content**: 5 complete integration scenarios with code examples
- **Scenarios**: Data collection, voice synthesis, training pipeline, cache management, compliance
- **Includes**: Performance targets, troubleshooting guide, implementation checklist

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file (pending)

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
