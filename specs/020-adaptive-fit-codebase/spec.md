# Feature Specification: Adaptive Fit Codebase Audit and Refactor

**Feature Branch**: `020-adaptive-fit-codebase`  
**Created**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Adaptive Fit: Codebase Audit and Refactor Spec Kit for Feature Implementation"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11

- Q: What specific criteria define "constitution alignment" for each of the 18 tasks? ‚Üí A: Strict compliance with all 7 core principles (user-centric, adaptability, cost-effectiveness, scalability, safety/privacy, engagement, data ethics)
- Q: What specific criteria determine if a feature is "implemented" vs "needs refinement" in the audit? ‚Üí A: Code exists, runs without errors, meets functional requirements, and aligns with constitution principles
- Q: How should conflicts between existing implementations and constitution requirements be prioritized for resolution? ‚Üí A: Prioritize safety, privacy, scalability
- Q: What is the required structure and format for the comprehensive audit report? ‚Üí A: Markdown document with sections for each of the 18 tasks, implementation status, conflicts, and recommendations
- Q: What are the success criteria and timeline for completing the codebase audit and refactor? ‚Üí A: Audit complete in 1 week

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a solo developer maintaining the Adaptive Fit fitness application, I need to audit the existing codebase to identify implemented features, missing functionality, and conflicts, then refactor the spec kit to ensure all 18 identified tasks are properly implemented and aligned with the project constitution, so that the application can scale from beta to 10,000 users while maintaining safety, privacy, and user experience standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an existing Adaptive Fit codebase with partial implementations, **When** I run the audit process, **Then** I receive a comprehensive report identifying implemented, missing, and conflicting features
2. **Given** identified conflicts in the codebase (e.g., fee mismatches, backend overlaps), **When** I review the audit report, **Then** all conflicts are flagged with clarification requests
3. **Given** missing features from the 18-task list, **When** I implement them, **Then** they align with the constitution and existing specs
4. **Given** Llama 3.1 8B integration requirements, **When** I replace DistilGPT-2 instances, **Then** all AI features use local, privacy-preserving processing
5. **Given** the audit process timeline requirement, **When** 1 week has passed, **Then** the comprehensive audit report is complete with all 18 tasks reviewed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when existing implementations conflict with constitution requirements?
- How does the system handle partial implementations that need refinement vs complete rewrites?
- What occurs when audit reveals duplicate functionality across different spec areas?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST audit existing codebase for all 18 identified tasks and determine implementation status (implemented: code exists, runs without errors, meets functional requirements, and aligns with constitution principles; needs refinement: partial implementation or misaligned; missing: not implemented)
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify conflicts between existing implementations and constitution requirements, prioritizing by safety, privacy, and scalability impact
- **FR-003**: System MUST flag all conflicts with specific clarification requests for resolution, ordered by priority (safety/privacy first, then scalability, then other constitution principles)
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate comprehensive audit report as a Markdown document with sections for each of the 18 tasks, implementation status, conflicts, and recommendations
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure all features align with constitution principles (user-centric, adaptability, cost-effectiveness, scalability, safety/privacy, engagement, data ethics) through strict compliance with all 7 core principles
- **FR-006**: System MUST replace all DistilGPT-2 instances with Llama 3.1 8B (4-bit, local via Capacitor/llama.cpp)
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement missing features from the 18-task audit with proper spec alignment
- **FR-008**: System MUST refine out-of-line implementations to match specs and constitution
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent duplicate implementations across different feature areas
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure all implementations support 1-10,000 concurrent users with specified performance targets

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Audit Report**: Contains implementation status, conflicts, and clarification flags for each of the 18 tasks
- **Feature Status**: Tracks whether each task is implemented, missing, or needs refinement with specific alignment notes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Documents conflicts between implementations and provides clarification requests
- **Constitution Alignment**: Ensures all features meet the 7 core principles and operational constraints
