# Feature Specification: Data Management & Privacy Compliance

**Feature Branch**: `008-data-privacy-compliance`
**Created**: September 29, 2025
**Status**: Active
**Priority**: Critical - Required for production launch and legal compliance

## Overview

Comprehensive data management and privacy compliance system that ensures GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance for fitness and health data. Implements automated data retention policies, user-controlled data export/deletion, encryption standards, audit logging, and privacy controls necessary for production deployment.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A user wants full control over their personal data in Adaptive fIt, including the ability to view what data is collected, export their complete data profile, delete specific data categories, and manage privacy preferences. The system automatically handles data retention, anonymization, and compliance requirements while maintaining transparent communication about data usage.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user requests data export, **When** they click "Download My Data", **Then** they receive a complete ZIP file with all their data in JSON format within 30 days (GDPR compliance).

2. **Given** a user wants to delete their account, **When** they confirm deletion, **Then** all personal data is permanently removed within 30 days while preserving anonymized analytics data.

3. **Given** a user from the EU, **When** they sign up, **Then** they see explicit GDPR consent forms with granular privacy controls and right to withdraw consent.

4. **Given** health data reaches 7-year retention limit, **When** automated cleanup runs, **Then** old data is securely deleted while preserving summarized statistics.

5. **Given** a data breach occurs, **When** the incident is detected, **Then** affected users are notified within 72 hours with breach details and mitigation steps.

### Edge Cases

- User exports data during active workout sessions
- Account deletion request while subscription is active
- Data export for deceased user (family request)
- Cross-border data transfer compliance
- Minor user data (parental consent and control)
