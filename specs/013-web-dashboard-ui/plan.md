# Implementation Plan: Web Dashboard UI

**Branch**: `013-web-dashboard-ui` | **Date**: September 30, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/013-web-dashboard-ui/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a web dashboard UI that replicates the mobile app's visual style and functionality, providing users with workout summaries, macro calculator, trainer access, and data synchronization features. The dashboard enables seamless cross-platform user experience while maintaining mobile-first functionality boundaries.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, JavaScript ES2022  
**Primary Dependencies**: SvelteKit 2.22+, Convex 1.27+, Tailwind CSS 4.1+  
**Storage**: Convex real-time database with offline-capable storage  
**Testing**: Vitest 3.2+, @testing-library/svelte  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (responsive design 320px to 4K)  
**Project Type**: web (SvelteKit frontend + Convex backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms interaction response, <2s load times, 10,000 concurrent users  
**Constraints**: No live workout tracking, mobile visual style replication, auto-scaling infrastructure  
**Scale/Scope**: 60 functional requirements, 7 key entities, comprehensive trainer access system

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **User-Centric Design**: Dashboard prioritizes user needs with intuitive workout tracking, nutrition logging, and trainer collaboration  
✅ **Adaptability and Learning**: Integrates with existing AI learning system via API calls to adaptation endpoints  
✅ **Cost-Effectiveness**: Extends existing SvelteKit/Convex infrastructure, no additional hosting costs  
✅ **Scalability and Performance**: Auto-scaling infrastructure specified, <500ms response targets align with <200ms API goals  
✅ **Safety and Privacy**: WebAuthn biometric auth, encrypted QR tokens, audit logging for trainer access  
✅ **Engagement and Gamification**: Visual style replication maintains existing gamified mobile experience  
✅ **Data Ethics & Transparency**: User-controlled data retention, clear conflict resolution interfaces  
✅ **Existing Code Analysis**: Extends existing Convex schema, leverages current auth system, integrates with mobile sync

**Constitutional Compliance**: PASS - All principles satisfied within existing architecture

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - SvelteKit frontend with Convex backend detected

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Task Categories**:
1. **Contract Tests** (8 tasks): Authentication, Workouts, Macros, Trainer, Food APIs
2. **Data Models** (7 tasks): User, Workout, Exercise, Macro, Trainer, Relationship, CustomFood entities
3. **Integration Tests** (5 tasks): User stories from quickstart.md
4. **UI Components** (12 tasks): Authentication, Dashboard, Workouts, Macros, Trainer, Settings pages
5. **Performance & Security** (3 tasks): Response time validation, scalability testing, security hardening
6. **Visual Style** (2 tasks): Mobile UI replication, responsive design
7. **Documentation** (3 tasks): API docs, user guides, deployment instructions

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
