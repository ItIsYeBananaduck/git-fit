# Research & Technology Decisions

**Feature**: Web Dashboard UI  
**Date**: September 30, 2025  

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Frontend Framework Decision
**Decision**: SvelteKit 2.22+  
**Rationale**: 
- Already adopted in the existing mobile app architecture
- Excellent TypeScript support with built-in type safety
- Server-side rendering capabilities for better performance
- Reactive UI updates work well with real-time Convex database
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns

**Alternatives considered**: 
- React/Next.js: More ecosystem options but would fragment the tech stack
- Vue/Nuxt: Good DX but team already familiar with Svelte
- Vanilla TypeScript: Faster but much more development overhead

### CSS Framework Decision
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS 4.1+  
**Rationale**:
- Already configured in the existing project
- Utility-first approach enables precise mobile UI replication
- Built-in responsive design utilities (320px to 4K requirement)
- Consistent design tokens across mobile and web

**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS Modules: More control but slower development
- Styled Components: Good component isolation but larger bundle size
- Material UI: Pre-built components but conflicts with mobile design replication

### Database & Real-time Updates
**Decision**: Convex 1.27+ with real-time subscriptions  
**Rationale**:
- Existing database schema already supports all required entities
- Built-in real-time capabilities for live data sync
- TypeScript-first API with excellent DX
- Offline-capable with automatic sync when reconnected
- Handles conflict resolution at the database level

**Alternatives considered**:
- Firebase: Good real-time features but would require migration
- PostgreSQL + WebSocket: More control but complex setup
- Supabase: Good features but another migration effort

### Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: WebAuthn + Email/Password fallback  
**Rationale**:
- WebAuthn provides biometric authentication as specified
- Builds on existing authentication patterns in the app
- Email/password fallback ensures broad compatibility
- Secure token management for trainer QR codes

**Alternatives considered**:
- Social OAuth only: Specification explicitly excludes social options
- Password-only: Less secure and poor UX
- Magic links: Good UX but email dependency issues

### State Management Decision
**Decision**: Svelte stores + Convex reactive queries  
**Rationale**:
- Svelte's built-in reactivity handles UI state efficiently
- Convex queries provide automatic cache invalidation
- Minimal additional dependencies required
- Consistent with existing mobile app patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for this scope, adds complexity
- Zustand: Good but Svelte stores are more idiomatic
- Context API: Not applicable to Svelte

## Performance & Scaling Patterns

### Responsive Design Approach
**Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints  
**Rationale**:
- Mobile UI replication requirement mandates mobile-first approach
- Tailwind's responsive utilities handle 320px to 4K range effectively
- Progressive enhancement ensures performance on all devices

### Image and Asset Optimization
**Decision**: Modern web formats with fallbacks  
**Rationale**:
- WebP/AVIF for better compression
- Lazy loading for workout summaries and trainer data
- CDN integration through Convex file storage

### Bundle Optimization
**Decision**: SvelteKit's built-in optimization + code splitting  
**Rationale**:
- Route-based code splitting reduces initial load time
- Tree shaking eliminates unused Tailwind classes
- Server-side rendering improves Time to First Contentful Paint

## Security & Privacy Patterns

### QR Code Security Implementation
**Decision**: JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration + server-side validation  
**Rationale**:
- Meets specification requirement for encrypted tokens
- Server-side validation prevents token manipulation
- Short expiration window limits exposure risk
- One-time use pattern prevents replay attacks

### Data Protection Strategy
**Decision**: Client-side encryption for sensitive data + Convex security rules  
**Rationale**:
- Trainer access audit logging meets compliance requirements
- User-controlled data retention aligns with privacy principles
- Row-level security prevents unauthorized data access

## Integration Patterns

### Mobile-Web Sync Strategy
**Decision**: Convex real-time subscriptions with conflict resolution UI  
**Rationale**:
- Real-time sync prevents most conflicts
- Side-by-side comparison UI handles remaining conflicts as specified
- Automatic merging for non-conflicting fields reduces user intervention

### API Design Approach
**Decision**: Convex functions with TypeScript contracts  
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe API calls prevent runtime errors
- Built-in optimistic updates improve perceived performance
- Automatic retry logic handles network issues

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
**Decision**: Vitest + @testing-library/svelte  
**Rationale**:
- Already configured in the project
- Component-level testing ensures UI behavior correctness
- Fast test execution supports TDD workflow

### Integration Testing
**Decision**: Playwright for E2E scenarios  
**Rationale**:
- Cross-browser testing ensures compatibility
- User scenario validation from specification
- Visual regression testing for mobile UI replication

### Performance Testing
**Decision**: Lighthouse CI + synthetic monitoring  
**Rationale**:
- Validates <500ms interaction and <2s load requirements
- Continuous performance monitoring
- Real User Metrics integration

## Development Workflow

### Component Architecture
**Decision**: Atomic design principles with Svelte components  
**Rationale**:
- Reusable components enable mobile UI replication
- Clear component hierarchy aids maintainability
- Consistent with existing mobile component patterns

### Development Environment
**Decision**: Vite dev server with HMR + Convex dev instance  
**Rationale**:
- Fast development iteration cycles
- Real-time database changes during development
- TypeScript compilation and checking
