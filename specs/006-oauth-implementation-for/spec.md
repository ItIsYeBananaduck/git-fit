# Feature Specification: OAuth Implementation & Platform-Specific UI for AdaptiveFit

**Feature Branch**: `006-oauth-implementation-for`  
**Created**: September 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "OAuth Implementation for AdaptiveFit via Convex + UI Separation with Capacitor - Implement OAuth authentication in AdaptiveFit, a fitness app with AI-driven coaching (Alice/Aiden, fine-tuned GPT-2), using Convex as the backend. Enable secure integration with Spotify/Apple Music for StrainSync Radio and external Stripe payments for trainer-client transactions. Additionally, implement platform-specific UI separation using Capacitor: restrict workout tracking to mobile (phone/tablet), place dashboard summaries and marketplace on web-only, ensure minimalist design with 3D avatars, and bypass Apple's in-app purchase fees. Support 10k concurrent users with real-time updates (1-5s) while maintaining privacy and user control over all features."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a fitness app client, I want to securely connect my music streaming service to enhance my workouts with StrainSync Radio, access different features based on my device (mobile for workouts, web for summaries), and interact with minimalist 3D AI coaches (Alice/Aiden). As a trainer (determined by active subscription status), I want to monitor multiple clients simultaneously on tablet devices, accept payments from clients through encrypted chat, and sell training programs through the marketplace while maintaining privacy and bypassing app store fees.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user wants music integration, **When** they tap "Connect Spotify/Apple Music" in settings, **Then** they are redirected to OAuth login and can successfully authorize the connection
2. **Given** a connected music service, **When** a user starts a workout on mobile, **Then** the system logs music metadata (BPM, genre) alongside their strain data for performance insights
3. **Given** a user on mobile phone, **When** they navigate the app, **Then** they see a minimalist 4-icon bottom navigation (Home, Track, Crew, Me) with swipe-up Quick Drawer for settings
4. **Given** a user on mobile phone, **When** they tap the bottom-right corner, **Then** a 3D avatar (Alice/Aiden) fades in and provides coaching guidance
5. **Given** a trainer on tablet, **When** they open the app, **Then** they see a clipboard-style dashboard with client list, strain bars, and can swipe-left for client selection
6. **Given** a trainer wants to sell a program, **When** they send a payment code via encrypted chat, **Then** the client can enter the code to unlock the program without triggering in-app purchase flows
7. **Given** a client reaches 85% strain during training, **When** the system detects this redline event, **Then** their trainer receives a real-time alert within 5 seconds via toast notification
8. **Given** a user wants to access marketplace, **When** they tap marketplace link on mobile, **Then** they are redirected to external web browser to avoid in-app purchase restrictions
9. **Given** a user accesses the web platform, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** they see historical summaries (strain graphs, intensity scores, music mood analysis) but cannot log new workouts
10. **Given** a user wants privacy control, **When** they disable music integration, **Then** all stored music metadata is immediately deleted and no future data is collected

### Edge Cases

- What happens when OAuth tokens expire during an active workout session?
- How does the system handle payment disputes or failed Stripe transactions?
- What occurs when a user revokes OAuth permissions directly from Spotify/Apple Music?
- How does the system behave when real-time strain monitoring fails to deliver alerts within 5 seconds?
- What happens when encrypted chat messages fail to decrypt properly?
- How does the app detect and handle switching between phone and tablet modes?
- What occurs when 3D avatar models fail to load on mobile devices?
- How does the system handle concurrent users exceeding 10,000 limit?
- What happens when external marketplace links fail to open in browser?
