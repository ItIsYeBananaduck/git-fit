# Research: OAuth Implementation & Platform-Specific UI for AdaptiveFit

**Date**: September 28, 2025  
**Feature**: OAuth Implementation & Platform-Specific UI for AdaptiveFit  
**Status**: Complete

## OAuth Provider Integration Research

### Spotify Web API OAuth 2.0
**Decision**: Use Spotify Web API with Authorization Code with PKCE flow  
**Rationale**: 
- PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) provides enhanced security for client applications
- Supports refresh tokens for seamless re-authentication
- Provides track metadata including BPM and genre through Audio Features endpoint
- Well-documented with TypeScript SDK available

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Implicit Grant (rejected: deprecated and less secure)
- Client Credentials (rejected: requires user permission for track data)

**Implementation notes**:
- Use `@spotify/web-api-sdk` npm package for TypeScript support
- Required scopes: `user-read-playback-state`, `user-read-currently-playing`
- Token storage in Capacitor SecureStorage for mobile, IndexedDB for web

### Apple Music API OAuth
**Decision**: Use Apple Music API with developer tokens and user tokens  
**Rationale**:
- MusicKit JS provides browser-based integration
- User tokens allow access to user's library and listening history
- Metadata includes BPM and genre information
- Official Apple SDK with TypeScript definitions

**Alternatives considered**:
- MediaPlayer framework (rejected: requires native iOS development)
- Third-party APIs (rejected: violates Apple's terms of service)

**Implementation notes**:
- Requires Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
- Use MusicKit JS for web, native MusicKit for iOS
- Developer token has 6-month expiration, user tokens refresh automatically

## Platform-Specific UI Research

### Capacitor Cross-Platform Architecture
**Decision**: Single codebase with platform-specific UI components using Capacitor  
**Rationale**:
- Existing SvelteKit + Capacitor setup already proven in codebase
- Platform detection via `Capacitor.getPlatform()`
- Conditional rendering based on screen size and platform
- Native plugin access for device APIs (SecureStorage, Browser, etc.)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate native apps (rejected: increased maintenance overhead)
- PWA only (rejected: limited mobile API access)

**Implementation patterns**:
```typescript
// Platform detection pattern
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';
const platform = Capacitor.getPlatform(); // 'web', 'ios', 'android'
const isTablet = window.innerWidth >= 768;
```

### 3D Avatar Integration (Alice/Aiden)
**Decision**: Use Three.js with @capacitor-community/three loader for GLB models  
**Rationale**:
- Three.js has proven WebGL support across platforms
- GLB format provides optimized file size and loading
- Capacitor Three community plugin enables native rendering acceleration
- Fade-in animations via CSS transitions

**Alternatives considered**:
- Native 3D frameworks (rejected: platform-specific implementation required)
- WebXR (rejected: limited browser support)
- 2D animations (rejected: less engaging user experience)

## Real-Time Architecture Research

### Convex Real-Time Scaling
**Decision**: Use Convex subscriptions with auto-scaling configuration  
**Rationale**:
- Existing Convex infrastructure already handles real-time updates
- Built-in horizontal scaling handles 10k+ concurrent connections
- WebSocket fallback ensures cross-platform compatibility
- Server-side functions scale automatically based on load

**Scaling configuration**:
- Connection pooling for WebSocket management
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per user for OAuth operations
- Batch processing for music metadata correlation

### Strain Monitoring Performance
**Decision**: Client-side calculation with server-side alert triggering  
**Rationale**:
- Reduces server load by calculating strain locally
- 85% threshold detection triggers immediate server notification
- 5-second SLA requires client-side processing for responsiveness
- Trainer notifications via Convex real-time subscriptions

## Security & Compliance Research

### End-to-End Encryption Implementation
**Decision**: Use Web Crypto API with AES-GCM encryption  
**Rationale**:
- Native browser support, no external dependencies
- AES-GCM provides authenticated encryption
- Key exchange via Diffie-Hellman for trainer-client communication
- Compatible with Capacitor's SecureStorage for key management

**Key management**:
- Per-conversation encryption keys stored in SecureStorage
- Keys rotated every 30 days for enhanced security
- Public key distribution via Convex with signature verification

### GDPR/CCPA Compliance Architecture
**Decision**: Privacy-by-design data architecture with automatic retention management  
**Rationale**:
- Convex scheduled functions handle automatic 6-month data cleanup
- User consent tracking with granular permission management
- Data export functionality for user rights requests
- Anonymous data correlation prevents personal identification

**Data retention schedule**:
- OAuth tokens: Until user disconnects service
- Music metadata: 6 months or until user opts out
- Encrypted messages: 30 days after conversation ends
- User deletion requests: Complete within 30 days

## Payment Integration Research

### Stripe Integration for Apple IAP Bypass
**Decision**: External browser redirect for payment processing  
**Rationale**:
- Capacitor Browser plugin opens external payment URLs
- Completely bypasses Apple's in-app purchase restrictions
- Webhook-based payment confirmation ensures security
- Server-side commission calculation (30% standard, 10% pro users)

**Implementation flow**:
1. Trainer shares payment code via encrypted chat
2. Client taps marketplace link â†’ Browser.open() to external site
3. Stripe Checkout session with custom success URL
4. Webhook processes payment and unlocks content in Convex
5. Real-time notification to client via Convex subscription

## Performance Optimization Research

### OAuth Token Management
**Decision**: Proactive token refresh with 5-minute buffer  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents workout interruption from expired tokens
- Background refresh task runs every hour during active sessions
- Fallback graceful degradation continues workout without music logging
- Error recovery automatically retries authentication flow

### Mobile Performance Optimization
**Decision**: Lazy loading with component-level code splitting  
**Rationale**:
- 3D avatar models loaded only when activated
- OAuth providers loaded on-demand when user enables integration
- Platform-specific UI components bundled separately
- Service Worker caching for offline capability

## Integration Testing Strategy

### OAuth Flow Testing
**Decision**: Use Playwright with mock OAuth providers for E2E testing  
**Rationale**:
- Real OAuth flows in development/staging environments
- Mock providers prevent test flakiness in CI/CD
- Token refresh scenarios tested automatically
- Cross-platform testing via Capacitor emulation

**Test scenarios**:
- Initial OAuth authorization (success/failure)
- Token refresh during active workout
- Network interruption recovery
- User permission revocation handling

## Technical Debt Assessment

### Existing Convex Schema Integration
**Finding**: Current schema supports OAuth integration with minor extensions  
**Required changes**:
- Add `oauthTokens` table with proper indexing
- Extend `users` table with music integration preferences
- Add `musicMetadata` correlation tracking
- Payment system already implemented via Stripe

### Mobile Platform Compatibility
**Finding**: Existing Capacitor setup supports required plugins  
**Required additions**:
- `@capacitor/browser` for external payment links
- `@capacitor-community/secure-storage` for token management  
- `@capacitor/haptics` for tactile feedback during strain alerts
- Platform capability detection for feature availability

## Development Timeline Estimate
