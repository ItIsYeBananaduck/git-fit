## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
### Unilateral Movement Tracking Tests
- [ ] T004 [P] Contract test unilateral movement detection in app/src/lib/__tests__/contract/unilateral-tracking.test.ts
- [ ] T005 [P] Integration test asymmetry detection in app/src/lib/__tests__/integration/asymmetry-detection.test.ts

### Superset Support Tests
- [ ] T006 [P] Contract test superset creation in app/src/lib/__tests__/contract/superset-creation.test.ts
- [ ] T007 [P] Integration test superset execution in app/src/lib/__tests__/integration/superset-execution.test.ts

### Safety Monitoring Tests
- [ ] T008 [P] Contract test safety threshold detection in app/src/lib/__tests__/contract/safety-monitoring.test.ts
- [ ] T009 [P] Integration test emergency protocols in app/src/lib/__tests__/integration/emergency-protocols.test.ts

## Phase 3.3: Data Models & Types
- [ ] T010 [P] Unilateral movement types in app/src/types/unilateral.d.ts
- [ ] T011 [P] Superset configuration types in app/src/types/supersets.d.ts

- [ ] T013 Update Convex schema with unilateral tracking tables in app/convex/schema.ts
- [ ] T014 Update Convex schema with superset definitions in app/convex/schema.ts

## Phase 3.4: Core Implementation
- [ ] T015 [P] UnilateralTrackingService in app/src/lib/services/unilateralTracking.ts
- [ ] T016 [P] SupersetService in app/src/lib/services/supersetService.ts
- [ ] T017 [P] SafetyMonitoringService in app/src/lib/services/safetyMonitoring.ts
- [ ] T018 Extend AdaptiveTrainingEngine with unilateral tracking in app/src/lib/services/adaptiveTraining.ts
- [ ] T019 Add superset support to MultiTrackerAdaptiveEngine in app/src/lib/services/multiTrackerAdaptive.ts

## Phase 3.5: UI Components
- [ ] T020 [P] Unilateral movement visualization in app/src/lib/components/training/UnilateralTracker.svelte
