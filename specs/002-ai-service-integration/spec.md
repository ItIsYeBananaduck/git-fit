# Feature Specification: AI Service Integration

**Feature Branch**: `002-ai-service-integration`  
**Created**: September 24, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Integrate the deployed AI service (https://technically-fit-ai.fly.dev/) with the main Technically Fit app to provide real-time workout adjustments, user preference learning, and intelligent fallback mechanisms during workouts"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Completed: Need to integrate deployed AI service with main app
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: pro users, free users (fallback), trainers
   → Actions: real-time workout adjustments, preference learning, fallback handling
   → Data: workout events, user preferences, AI recommendations, fallback rules
   → Constraints: <200ms response, 100% uptime via fallbacks, cost-effective
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All aspects clarified based on existing AI service implementation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Completed: Integration scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Completed: All requirements testable and aligned with deployed service
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Completed: WorkoutEvent, AIRecommendation, UserPreference entities
7. Run Review Checklist
   → SUCCESS: Spec ready for planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Pro users receive intelligent workout adjustments during their training sessions by communicating with the deployed AI service at https://technically-fit-ai.fly.dev/. When users skip sets, complete workouts, or struggle with exercises, the app sends event data to the AI service and applies the returned recommendations (e.g., reduce volume, increase weight, extend rest). Free users receive rule-based fallback recommendations that maintain the same safety standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a pro user skips a set during their workout, **When** the app sends a "skip_set" event to the AI service, **Then** the user receives a volume reduction recommendation (e.g., "reduce remaining sets by 1")
2. **Given** a pro user successfully completes a challenging workout, **When** the app sends a "complete_workout" event, **Then** the user receives a progressive overload recommendation (e.g., "increase weight by 2.5lbs next session")
3. **Given** the AI service is unavailable, **When** a user performs any workout action, **Then** the app provides intelligent fallback recommendations maintaining 80% rep minimum safety rules
4. **Given** a free user performs workout actions, **When** the app processes their events, **Then** they receive the same fallback recommendations as when AI is unavailable (ensuring consistent experience)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the AI service response takes longer than 5 seconds? App uses fallback recommendations with user notification of degraded service.
- How does the system handle invalid AI service responses? App validates responses and falls back to rule-based recommendations on validation failure.
- What happens when user preferences conflict with AI recommendations? User preferences override AI suggestions with safety rule validation.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST send workout events (skip_set, complete_workout, struggle_set) to the deployed AI service at https://technically-fit-ai.fly.dev/event
- **FR-002**: System MUST handle AI service responses within 5 seconds, falling back to rule-based recommendations on timeout
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate AI recommendations against safety rules (80% rep minimum, progressive overload principles)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide identical fallback recommendations for free users as used when AI service is unavailable
- **FR-005**: System MUST track user acceptance/rejection of AI recommendations to improve future suggestions
- **FR-006**: System MUST display AI-powered status to pro users and fallback status to free users transparently
- **FR-007**: System MUST cache the last successful AI response per user to provide continuity during brief service outages
- **FR-008**: System MUST log all AI service interactions for debugging and service optimization
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle AI service maintenance windows gracefully with user notification
- **FR-010**: System MUST apply workout adjustments immediately upon receiving valid recommendations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **WorkoutEvent**: Represents user actions during workouts; attributes include event type, user context, workout data, timestamp
- **AIRecommendation**: Represents AI service responses; attributes include action type, reason, modifications, confidence score
- **UserPreference**: Represents learned user behavior; attributes include exercise preferences, typical responses, override history
- **FallbackRule**: Represents rule-based alternatives; attributes include trigger conditions, safety constraints, recommendation logic
