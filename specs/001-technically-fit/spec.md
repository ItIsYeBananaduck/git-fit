# Feature Specification: Technically Fit

**Feature Branch**: `001-technically-fit`
**Created**: September 24, 2025
**Status**: Clarified
**Input**: User description: "Develop Technically Fit, a fitness marketplace and AI-powered coaching platform for lifters. It tracks workouts, nutrition, and sleep, integrates with wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Whoop, Samsung/Android Watch) for real-time tweaks (e.g., extend rest if heart rate > 150, reduce intensity if SpO2 < 95), and learns preferences (e.g., rack-pull over deadlift). It offers three tiers: free (no AI), pro ($15/month via Stripe/Apple), and trainer ($20/month via Stripe/Apple). Trainers approve mesocycle shifts and sell programs in a marketplace. The app provides gamified progress tracking and a delightful UI with post-beta 3D avatars (Alice/Aiden). Target beta in 1-2 weeks with 10-50 users, scaling to 100-1,000 at $0-$10/month, profitable with 1-2 pro users or 1 trainer. Use PubMed and YouTube (~40 videos, rss_knowledge.jsonl) for AI training. Ensure <200ms response, 100% uptime, and GDPR/Stripe PCI compliance."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Completed: Description parsed from user input
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: free users, pro users, trainers, admins
   → Actions: track workouts/nutrition/sleep, tweak workouts, browse/purchase programs
   → Data: workout logs, nutrition data, wearable data (HR, SpO2), training programs
   → Constraints: $0-$10/month, <200ms response, 100% uptime, GDPR/Stripe PCI
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → YouTube video URLs deferred to post-beta (use mock data for beta)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Completed: Primary story, acceptance scenarios, edge cases defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Completed: Testable requirements, ambiguities marked
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Completed: User, Workout, NutritionLog, Program, Equipment entities defined
7. Run Review Checklist
   → SUCCESS: All critical ambiguities resolved for beta launch
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning, pending clarification of ambiguities)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: What data format will be used for wearable device integration? → A: B (HealthKit/Health Connect native APIs)
- Q: How should Apple's 30% cut be handled in the payment flow? → A: B (Absorb 30% fee in platform pricing)
- Q: What should happen when wearable devices fail to send data? → A: Use rule-based defaults
- Q: Should YouTube video URLs be resolved before beta launch? → A: B (Defer to post-beta)
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A lifter uses Technically Fit to track workouts, nutrition, and sleep, receiving real-time workout tweaks based on wearable data (e.g., heart rate, SpO2). Pro users ($15/month) access AI-driven personalization, such as preferring rack-pull over deadlift, while trainers ($20/month) approve mesocycle shifts and sell programs in a marketplace. The app provides a gamified experience with progress tracking and a delightful UI, targeting a beta in 1-2 weeks with 10-50 users.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a pro user wearing a Fitbit, **When** their heart rate exceeds 150 during a workout, **Then** the app extends rest time by 30 seconds (e.g., 60s vs. 30s).
2. **Given** a pro user logs a preference for rack-pull, **When** the AI suggests a workout, **Then** it prioritizes rack-pull over deadlift.
3. **Given** a trainer user, **When** they upload a program to the marketplace, **Then** users can browse and purchase it for a subscription.
4. **Given** a free user, **When** they log a workout, **Then** the app saves it and displays progress without AI tweaks.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a wearable device fails to send data? System uses rule-based defaults for workout adjustments.
- How does the system handle invalid payment attempts? System must retry payment and notify user after three failures.
- What happens when a user exceeds the free tier usage limit? System prompts upgrade to pro ($15/month) or trainer ($20/month).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to log workouts, nutrition, and sleep data to track fitness progress.
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate with wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Whoop, Samsung/Android Watch) using HealthKit/Health Connect native APIs to collect HR and SpO2 data for real-time tweaks.
- **FR-003**: System MUST adjust workouts in real-time for pro users ($15/month), e.g., extend rest by 30s if HR > 150, reduce intensity if SpO2 < 95.
- **FR-004**: System MUST learn user preferences (e.g., rack-pull over deadlift) from logged tweaks, achieving ~80% accuracy by week 3.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure no workout rep drops below 80% to maintain intensity.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide fallback rule-based tweaks if AI is unavailable.
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow trainers ($20/month) to approve mesocycle shifts for safe client progress.
- **FR-008**: System MUST enable trainers to upload and sell programs in a marketplace.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to browse and purchase programs via subscriptions.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support payments for pro ($15/month) and trainer ($20/month) tiers via Stripe/Apple, with platform absorbing Apple's 30% fee to maintain transparent pricing.
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide gamified progress tracking with visual feedback for all users.
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow admins to moderate users and analyze usage data.
- **FR-013**: System MUST support user registration/login with 2FA (no password for beta).
