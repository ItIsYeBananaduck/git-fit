**Branch**: `001-technically-fit` | **Date**: September 24, 2025 | **Spec**: specs/001-technically-fit/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/workspaces/git-fit/specs/001-technically-fit/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Completed: Spec loaded from /workspaces/git-fit/specs/001-technically-fit/spec.md
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Project Type: web (frontend+backend architecture)
   → Structure Decision: SvelteKit frontend + FastAPI backend + Convex database
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → No violations found: All requirements align with constitution principles
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check ✓
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → No NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: All ambiguities resolved in clarify phase
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → No new violations: Design maintains constitutional compliance
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check ✓
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)
