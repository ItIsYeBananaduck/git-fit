# Feature Specification: Authentication System

**Feature Branch**: `001-authentication-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor, I can register and sign in using email/password or OAuth (Google/Apple) so I can access member features. My session is maintained via a secure cookie. Admins and trainers have elevated capabilities. Subscribers may have additional access.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Registration (email/password)
   - Given I am on the register page, when I submit a valid email and password (min 7 chars with at least one letter and one digit), then I receive a verification email and see a confirmation message.
2. Email verification
   - Given I received a verification email, when I click the link within its validity window, then my account becomes verified and I can sign in.
3. Sign in (email/password)
   - Given my account is verified, when I sign in with correct credentials, then I am redirected to the app and an httpOnly session cookie is set.
4. OAuth sign in
   - Given I choose Google or Apple, when I complete provider consent, then I am signed in (new users created on first login) and an httpOnly session cookie is set.
5. Password reset
   - Given I forgot my password, when I request a reset with my email, then a reset link is sent; when I follow it and provide a new valid password, then I can sign in with the new password.
6. Account lockout
   - Given I fail to sign in 5 times within a short period, then my account is temporarily locked and I am informed of the cooldown.
7. Role access
   - Given I am an admin, when I access admin pages, then I am allowed; given I am a trainer, when I access trainer tools, then I am allowed; given I am a standard user, when I access restricted areas, then I am redirected to Unauthorized.
8. Subscription role (optional)
   - Given I have an active subscription, when I access subscriber-only features, then I am allowed; otherwise I am informed and offered to subscribe.

### Edge Cases
- OAuth cancels/denies consent ‚Üí user is returned to login with an explanatory message.
- Verification or reset link expired/invalid ‚Üí show safe error and allow re-request.
- Concurrent sessions on multiple devices ‚Üí last sign-in should not invalidate others unless configured.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001 (Registration)**: Users MUST be able to register with email and password (min 7 characters; must include at least one letter and one digit).
- **FR-002 (Email Verification)**: System MUST send verification email on sign-up and require verification before sign-in with email/password.
- **FR-003 (OAuth)**: Users MUST be able to authenticate via Google and Apple; first-time OAuth sign-in creates a linked user.
- **FR-004 (Sign-in/Sign-out)**: Verified users MUST be able to sign in/out; successful sign-in sets a secure, httpOnly cookie-based session.
- **FR-005 (Password Reset)**: Users MUST be able to request password reset via email link and set a new password meeting policy.
- **FR-006 (Breach Check)**: Passwords MUST be checked against known breached lists; breached passwords are rejected with guidance.
- **FR-007 (Lockout Policy)**: After 5 failed attempts within a defined window, account MUST be temporarily locked with clear user messaging.
- **FR-008 (Roles/Permissions)**: Roles MUST include admin, trainer, and user; authorization MUST gate admin and trainer areas. A subscriber role MAY grant additional features.
- **FR-009 (Session Policy)**: Sessions MUST be cookie-based (httpOnly, Secure in production), include idle timeout (30 minutes) and max age (7 days).
- **FR-010 (Audit/Logging)**: Security events (registration, login success/failure, password reset requests, role changes) MUST be logged.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: id, email, emailVerifiedAt, roles [user, trainer, admin, subscriber?], passwordHash (for email/password users), oauthProvider, oauthSubject.
- **Session**: id, userId, createdAt, lastActivityAt, expiresAt, ip/userAgent (for security/audit), revokedAt.
- **PasswordResetToken**: token, userId, createdAt, expiresAt, usedAt.
- **EmailVerificationToken**: token, userId, createdAt, expiresAt, usedAt.
