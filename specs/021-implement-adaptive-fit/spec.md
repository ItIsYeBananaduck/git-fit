# Feature Specification: Implement Adaptive Fit with Alice AI

**Feature Branch**: `021-implement-adaptive-fit`  
**Created**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Develop Adaptive Fit, a fitness app by Lone Star Cajun Technologies, using Svelte/Capacitor for the frontend, Convex for the backend, and Llama 3.1 8B (4-bit, local via Core ML/MLX) for the AI assistant Alice (Adaptive Learning Interactive Computation Engine). Support 1‚Äì10,000 concurrent users with low-end device compatibility (e.g., iPhone 12 fallback). Focus on privacy-first federated learning, weekly weight syncs, and a hybrid tone. No PowerShell, weekly/bi-weekly Fly.io updates, $10-15/month cost target."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Develop Adaptive Fit, a fitness app that integrates Alice AI to provide personalized fitness plans, privacy-first federated learning, and seamless user experience across devices.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has installed the app, **When** they launch it for the first time, **Then** they should see the privacy policy and agree to proceed.
2. **Given** a user has opted for the paid tier, **When** they sync their weekly weight data, **Then** the system should aggregate and train Alice AI securely.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user declines the privacy policy?
- How does the system handle network failures during weight sync?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display the privacy policy on first launch.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to sync weekly weight data securely.
- **FR-003**: Paid users MUST have access to pro features like custom plans and nutrition tracking.
- **FR-004**: System MUST aggregate weight data using secure federated learning.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support 1‚Äì10,000 concurrent users.
- **FR-006**: System MUST fallback to TinyLlama 1B for low-end devices.
- **FR-007**: System MUST update Fly.io weekly/bi-weekly within a $10-15/month cost target.
- **FR-008**: System MUST exclude PowerShell and map-based features.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **User**: Represents app users, attributes include tier (free/paid), weight data (hashed/encrypted), tokenized weights.
- **Alice AI**: Represents the AI assistant, attributes include model updates, training data.
- **Privacy Policy**: Represents user agreement, attributes include acceptance status.

### Non-Functional Quality Attributes

- **Performance**: System MUST support low latency for up to 10,000 users.
- **Reliability**: System MUST retry weight sync failures and provide local fallback.
- **Compliance**: System MUST adhere to Apple privacy guidelines and EU AI Act regulations.
