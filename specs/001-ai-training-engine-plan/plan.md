# Implementation Plan: AI Training Engine

## Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation plan for the AI Training Engine. The plan includes the architecture, technology stack, and a breakdown of tasks required to complete the project.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Svelte with Vite for a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Convex for serverless functions and data management.
- **Database**: Convex's built-in data model for real-time updates.
- **Mobile Support**: Capacitor for cross-platform deployment.
- **Authentication**: Convex's built-in authentication system.
- **Payments**: Stripe for payment processing.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Convex
- **Mobile**: Capacitor
- **Authentication**: Convex
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit and integration tests

## Tasks

1. **Frontend Development**

   - Set up the Svelte project with Vite.
   - Design and implement the user interface for the AI Training Engine.
   - Integrate frontend with backend APIs.
   - Implement authentication flows using Convex's built-in authentication.
   - Integrate Stripe for payment processing in the frontend.

2. **Backend Development**

   - Define the data model using Convex.
   - Implement serverless functions for AI training workflows.
   - Set up authentication using Convex's built-in system.
   - Create API endpoints for data services and payment processing.
   - Integrate Stripe for handling payment-related backend logic.

3. **Mobile Deployment**

   - Configure Capacitor for iOS and Android builds.
   - Test mobile functionality and performance.

4. **Testing and Validation**

   - Write unit tests for frontend and backend components.
   - Perform integration testing for end-to-end workflows.
   - Validate mobile app functionality on multiple devices.

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the backend to Convex.
   - Publish mobile apps to App Store and Google Play.
