# Research: Medical Screening & User Onboarding

**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Context**: Technical research for medical screening and user onboarding feature

## Key Research Areas

### 1. HIPAA Compliance Requirements for Fitness Applications

**Decision**: Implement full HIPAA compliance with AES-256 encryption and audit logging
**Rationale**: 
- Fitness apps collecting medical data fall under HIPAA if health information is used for health-related decisions
- Liability protection requires demonstrable compliance with healthcare data standards
- User trust and legal protection justify implementation cost
- Proactive compliance easier than retrofitting

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic privacy compliance only: Rejected due to liability concerns and medical decision-making use case
- Third-party HIPAA service: Rejected due to cost and data control concerns
- Disclaimer-only approach: Insufficient legal protection for medical screening

**Implementation approach**: Client-side encryption before transmission, encrypted storage in Convex, comprehensive audit logging, explicit consent mechanisms

### 2. Medical Risk Assessment Algorithms

**Decision**: Rule-based risk assessment with defined thresholds and medical clearance requirements
**Rationale**:
- Clear, auditable rules provide legal defensibility
- Medical professionals can review and validate risk criteria
- Deterministic outcomes ensure consistent safety decisions
- Easier to update rules as medical guidelines evolve

**Risk Categories**:
- Low: No significant conditions, minor resolved injuries, minimal medication impact
- Moderate: Controlled chronic conditions, minor current injuries, moderate medication interactions
- High: Multiple conditions, uncontrolled conditions, significant injury history
- Requires Clearance: Heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, recent surgery, severe conditions

**Alternatives considered**:
- AI-based risk assessment: Rejected due to lack of interpretability and regulatory concerns
- Self-assessment only: Insufficient for liability protection
- Universal medical clearance: Too restrictive and cost-prohibitive for users

**Implementation approach**: Create MedicalRiskAssessment service with scoring algorithm, condition-specific rules, and automatic restriction generation

### 3. Exercise Restriction and Contraindication Systems

**Decision**: Comprehensive exercise restriction mapping based on medical conditions and injuries
**Rationale**:
- Evidence-based contraindications protect users from harmful exercises
- Automated restriction application ensures consistent safety enforcement
- Alternative exercise suggestions maintain engagement while ensuring safety
- Integration with AI workout generation provides seamless safety constraints

**Restriction Categories**:
- Cardiovascular: Heart rate limits, intensity caps, specific exercise exclusions
- Metabolic: Blood sugar monitoring, timing restrictions, intensity modifications
- Musculoskeletal: Movement pattern exclusions, load limitations, joint-specific restrictions
- Medication-based: Interaction warnings, timing considerations, intensity modifications

**Implementation approach**: Create restriction mapping database, integrate with AI training engine, provide alternative exercise suggestions, implement safety monitoring

### 4. Training Split Recommendation Algorithm

**Decision**: Multi-factor recommendation engine considering goals, experience, time, equipment, and medical restrictions
**Rationale**:
- Personalized recommendations improve adherence and results
- Medical safety integration ensures appropriate training for health conditions
- Equipment and time constraints provide realistic program options
- Multiple options with explanations empower user choice

**Recommendation Factors**:
- Primary goal weight: 40% (strength, endurance, weight loss, muscle gain)
- Experience level: 25% (exercise complexity, progression rate)
- Time availability: 20% (frequency, session duration)
- Equipment access: 10% (exercise selection constraints)
- Medical restrictions: 5% (safety filter, intensity limits)

**Split Categories**:
- Beginner (1-2 years): Full body, upper/lower, push/pull
- Intermediate (2-5 years): PPL, upper/lower, body part splits
- Advanced (5+ years): Specialized splits, periodization, advanced techniques

**Implementation approach**: Create split database with metadata, recommendation scoring algorithm, comparison interface, customization options

### 5. Educational Content Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Contextual education delivery with progressive disclosure based on user selections
**Rationale**:
- Safety education reduces injury risk and improves form
- Contextual delivery prevents information overload
- Progressive disclosure matches content to user needs and experience
- Video demonstrations improve understanding and engagement

**Content Categories**:
- Exercise safety and form fundamentals
- Condition-specific exercise modifications
- Injury prevention and management
- Nutrition basics aligned with fitness goals
- Equipment usage and safety protocols

**Implementation approach**: Create educational content service, integrate with onboarding steps, provide contextual help system, include video demonstrations

### 6. Onboarding Flow Optimization

**Decision**: Multi-step flow with progress saving and logical progression
**Rationale**:
- Complex information collection requires organized approach
- Progress saving prevents user frustration from interruptions
- Logical flow (medical → goals → experience → equipment → selection) builds comprehensive profile
- Validation at each step ensures data quality

**Flow Structure**:
1. Privacy consent and medical screening (safety first)
2. Fitness goal identification and prioritization
3. Experience level and training history assessment
4. Equipment availability and time constraints
5. Training split recommendation and selection
6. Final review and program activation

**Implementation approach**: Extend existing OnboardingEngine with new steps, add progress persistence, implement validation gates, create review interface

### 7. Data Architecture for Medical Information

**Decision**: Separate medical profile entity with encrypted storage and access controls
**Rationale**:
- Medical data requires special handling separate from general user data
- Encrypted fields prevent unauthorized access even with database compromise
- Separate entity enables granular access controls and audit logging
- Clear data model supports compliance auditing and user rights

**Medical Data Entities**:
- MedicalProfile: Main container with encryption metadata
- ChronicCondition: Specific medical conditions with severity and control status
- Medication: Current medications with interaction warnings
- InjuryHistory: Past and current injuries with movement restrictions
- MedicalClearance: Healthcare provider clearances for high-risk users

**Implementation approach**: Create medical-specific Convex functions, implement field-level encryption, add audit logging, design access control patterns

### 8. Integration with Existing AI Training Engine

**Decision**: Extend existing AI engine with medical constraint parameters
**Rationale**:
- Leverage existing workout generation infrastructure
- Ensure medical restrictions are enforced automatically in all workouts
- Maintain existing user experience while adding safety features
- Avoid duplication of complex AI logic

**Integration Points**:
- Exercise exclusion based on medical restrictions
- Intensity capping based on risk assessment
- Alternative exercise suggestion when restrictions apply
- Safety monitoring and automatic adjustments
- Progression modifications for medical limitations

**Implementation approach**: Add medical parameter inputs to existing AI engine, create restriction enforcement layer, implement safety monitoring hooks

### 9. User Experience Design for Medical Screening

**Decision**: Transparent, educational approach with clear benefit communication
**Rationale**:
- Users need to understand why medical information is collected
- Transparency builds trust and improves completion rates
