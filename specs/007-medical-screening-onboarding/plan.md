# Implementation Plan: Medical Screening & User Onboarding

**Branch**: `007-medical-screening-onboarding` | **Date**: 2025-09-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Priority**: High - Essential for production safety and liability protection

## üö® **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION FOUND**

**Constitutional Compliance**: Following Constitution v1.2.0 - "Existing Code Analysis" principle, we discovered basic onboarding infrastructure already exists. This plan has been revised from greenfield implementation to enhancement and completion approach.

## Execution Flow (Audit-First Approach)
```
1. AUDIT existing onboarding infrastructure ‚úì
2. Compare existing functionality with specification requirements
3. Identify gaps and critical missing components
4. Plan development to complete medical screening system
5. Extend existing onboarding flow with medical safety features
6. Integrate with existing AI training engine for safety constraints
```

## Summary
**EXISTING SYSTEM DISCOVERED**: Basic onboarding flow exists in `app/src/lib/components/onboarding/` with `OnboardingEngine.ts`, `MedicalScreeningStep.svelte`, and `GoalIdentificationStep.svelte`. This plan shifts from greenfield development to **completion and enhancement** to meet comprehensive medical screening requirements while preserving existing functionality.

## Phase 2: Development Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**ENHANCEMENT APPROACH**: Complete existing onboarding with medical safety focus

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load existing onboarding components as foundation
- Generate completion tasks for medical safety features
- Prioritize liability protection and HIPAA compliance
- Integrate with existing AI training engine for safety constraints

**Specific Development Categories**:

1. **Medical Safety Implementation** (Priority 1 - CRITICAL):
   - Complete comprehensive medical screening questionnaire [P]
   - Implement risk assessment and flagging algorithm [P]
   - Add HIPAA-compliant data encryption and storage [P]
   - Create medical clearance workflow for high-risk users [P]
   - Integrate medical restrictions with AI workout generation [P]

2. **Goal & Experience Assessment** (Priority 2):
   - Expand fitness goal assessment with priority weighting [P]
   - Create comprehensive fitness level evaluation tools [P]
   - Add equipment availability and time preference assessment [P]
   - Build experience-based training customization [P]

3. **Training Split Recommendation** (Priority 3):
   - Develop training split recommendation algorithm [P]
   - Create split comparison and selection interface [P]
   - Build split customization and preview functionality [P]
   - Integrate recommendations with existing workout system [P]

4. **Educational Content & Polish** (Priority 4):
   - Add educational content delivery system [P]
   - Integrate exercise demonstration videos and images [P]
   - Complete accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA) [P]
   - Add comprehensive analytics and progress monitoring [P]

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Medical safety first**: Risk assessment and compliance before feature completion
- **Build on existing**: Extend current onboarding flow systematically
- **Safety integration**: Ensure medical flags propagate to workout generation
- **User experience**: Polish and educational content last

**Estimated Task Count**: **18-22 tasks** (vs 35-40 for greenfield) - **45% effort reduction**

**Critical Dependencies**:
- Medical safety must integrate with existing AI training engine
- HIPAA compliance requirements must be met before production
- All enhancements must preserve existing onboarding functionality
- Safety constraints must be fail-safe (default to safe when in doubt)

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md with medical safety priority)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (comprehensive testing, HIPAA audit, safety verification)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
