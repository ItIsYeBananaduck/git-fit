## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02

- Q: Watch Platform Priority: The spec mentions "Apple Watch first, Android Wear stretch" but doesn't specify which platforms are required for MVP vs future phases. → A: Platform-agnostic (any smartwatch)
- Q: Earbud Detection Scope: The spec requires detecting "earbuds" for wave animations but doesn't specify the detection mechanism or supported devices. → A: any bluetooth or wired audio device
- Q: Sync Failure Behavior: When the watch loses connection to the main app during a workout, how should exercise data be handled? → A: Continue offline, sync when reconnected (no data loss)
- Q: Performance Target for Orb Updates: The spec requires "real-time" orb color changes based on strain data but doesn't specify acceptable latency. → A: Real-time <250ms
- Q: Alice Persona Activation: The spec mentions disabling "Aiden as a persona type" but doesn't clarify if Alice should be the only available AI persona or if others remain. → A: aiden doesn not have a voice yet hide him for now keep alice

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a fitness app user, I want to personalize Alice's visual appearance and monitor my workouts on my smartwatch so that I have a more engaging and convenient workout experience that adapts to my exercise intensity in real-time.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Orb Customization

1. **Given** I'm in the app settings drawer, **When** I adjust the color slider to select a new hue, **Then** Alice's orb immediately changes to that color and the preference is saved
2. **Given** I'm working out with 78% strain intensity, **When** Alice's orb displays, **Then** the orb appears 20% lighter than my selected base color
3. **Given** I'm pushing hard at 105% strain intensity, **When** Alice's orb displays, **Then** the orb appears 20% darker than my selected base color
4. **Given** I'm at optimal 95% strain intensity, **When** Alice's orb displays, **Then** the orb shows my exact selected base color

#### Watch Interface

5. **Given** I'm wearing my smartwatch during a workout set, **When** I look at the watch, **Then** I see Alice's orb displaying current intensity percentage and exercise controls
6. **Given** I'm between sets during rest period, **When** I look at my watch, **Then** I see a countdown timer and a smaller "Start" button for the next set
7. **Given** I need to adjust my exercise, **When** I tap the +/- controls on my watch, **Then** reps and weight values update and sync to the main app
8. **Given** Alice is providing audio feedback through my earbuds, **When** she speaks, **Then** the orb displays animated wave effects on my watch

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no earbuds are connected during Alice's audio feedback?
- How does the system handle watch connectivity loss during a workout?
- What occurs if strain data becomes unavailable or invalid?
- How does the orb behave during workout transitions or app backgrounding?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Orb Customization

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to select Alice's orb color using a hue slider (0-360°) in the settings drawer
- **FR-002**: System MUST store the selected orb color in local device storage and persist across app sessions
- **FR-003**: System MUST dynamically adjust orb color brightness based on real-time strain data: lighten 20% when strain <90%, exact color at 90-100%, darken 20% when strain >100%
- **FR-004**: System MUST update orb appearance within 250ms when strain values change during workouts
- **FR-005**: System MUST default to electric blue (#00BFFF) when no custom color is selected

#### Watch Interface

- **FR-006**: System MUST display Alice's orb on any compatible smartwatch platform during active workouts
- **FR-007**: System MUST show current intensity percentage (0-120%) on the watch during exercise sets
- **FR-008**: System MUST display a 30-second countdown timer during rest periods between sets
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide tap controls on the watch to adjust reps (-/+1) and weight (-/+5lb increments)
- **FR-010**: System MUST sync all exercise adjustments from watch to the main app in real-time
- **FR-011**: System MUST display animated wave effects on the orb when Alice provides audio feedback and earbuds are detected
- **FR-012**: System MUST resize the orb to a smaller start button (50px) during rest periods and full size (100px) during active sets

#### Integration Requirements

- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain real-time synchronization between watch interface and main app, continue tracking offline during connectivity loss, and sync all data when connection is restored without data loss
- **FR-014**: System MUST detect any bluetooth or wired audio device connectivity status to control wave animations
- **FR-015**: System MUST hide Aiden persona option (voice not ready) and keep Alice as the primary available AI persona

### Key Entities

- **Alice Orb State**: Visual representation with base color, current adjusted color, size, animation state, and strain-based appearance modifications
- **User Color Preference**: Stored hue value (0-360°), persistence mechanism, and default fallback
- **Workout Strain Data**: Real-time intensity percentage, historical values, and data source validation
- **Exercise Session**: Current reps count, weight/volume settings, set timing, and rest period tracking
- **Watch Interface State**: Display mode (active/rest), control states, connectivity status, and synchronization state
- **Audio Feedback Context**: Earbud detection, Alice speaking events, and wave animation triggers
