# Research: Customizable Alice Orb Color & Watch Interface

## Technology Decisions

### Orb Color Customization

**Decision**: Use CSS custom properties with HSL color space manipulation  
**Rationale**:

- HSL provides intuitive hue-based user controls (0-360°)
- Lightness adjustments for strain visualization are mathematically simple
- CSS custom properties enable real-time updates without DOM manipulation
- Compatible with existing Svelte reactivity system

**Alternatives considered**:

- RGB manipulation: More complex math for brightness adjustments
- Canvas-based rendering: Overkill for simple color changes
- SVG filters: Less browser compatibility, more complex implementation

### Smartwatch Integration

**Decision**: Platform-agnostic approach using Capacitor Community Watch plugin  
**Rationale**:

- Single codebase for multiple watch platforms
- Leverages existing Capacitor infrastructure
- TypeScript support aligns with current stack
- Offline-first design matches constitutional requirements

**Alternatives considered**:

- Native WatchKit/Wear OS: Requires separate native development
- Web-based watch apps: Limited functionality and platform support
- Third-party SDKs: Additional dependencies and licensing concerns

### Real-time Synchronization

**Decision**: Convex real-time subscriptions with localStorage fallback  
**Rationale**:

- Existing Convex infrastructure handles real-time updates
- Built-in offline capability through Convex client
- localStorage provides immediate persistence for user preferences
- <250ms performance requirement achievable with local reactivity

**Alternatives considered**:

- WebSocket implementation: Duplicates Convex functionality
- Polling-based updates: Doesn't meet performance requirements
- IndexedDB: Overkill for simple preference storage

### Audio Device Detection

**Decision**: Web Audio API with Capacitor device plugins  
**Rationale**:

- Web Audio API provides cross-platform audio device enumeration
- Capacitor plugins handle platform-specific audio routing
- Supports both Bluetooth and wired devices as specified
- Minimal performance impact on battery life

**Alternatives considered**:

- Platform-specific audio APIs: Requires native code for each platform
- MediaDevices API only: Limited device type detection
- Third-party audio libraries: Unnecessary complexity

## Implementation Patterns

### Color State Management

- Use Svelte stores for reactive color state
- Implement color conversion utilities (HSL ↔ Hex)
- Cache computed colors to avoid repeated calculations
- Integrate with existing strain data subscriptions

### Watch Interface Architecture

- Component-based approach with shared UI elements
- Separate watch-specific layouts from phone layouts
- Implement optimistic updates for exercise adjustments
- Design offline-first with sync reconciliation

### Performance Optimization

- Debounce color updates for performance
- Use CSS transforms for smooth animations
- Implement efficient change detection for strain data
- Minimize watch app bundle size for faster loading

## Development Approach

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for color conversion functions
- Integration tests for watch synchronization
- Visual regression tests for orb appearance
- Performance tests for <250ms update requirement

### Rollout Plan

- Phase 1: Orb customization (lower risk, immediate user value)
- Phase 2: Watch interface (higher complexity, requires device testing)
- Progressive enhancement: Graceful degradation when watch unavailable

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Watch compatibility**: Test on multiple smartwatch platforms early
- **Performance degradation**: Implement throttling and optimization monitoring
- **Offline sync conflicts**: Design conflict resolution strategy
- **Audio device false positives**: Implement device type validation

### User Experience Risks

- **Color accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast in all strain states
- **Watch usability**: Design for small screen constraints
- **Sync confusion**: Provide clear offline/online status indicators
- **Learning curve**: Implement progressive disclosure of features
