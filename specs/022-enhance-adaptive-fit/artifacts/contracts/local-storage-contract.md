# Contract: Local Storage

## Purpose

Define the requirements and constraints for implementing local storage of user data using IndexedDB.

## Requirements

1. **Data Separation**:
   - User data must be stored locally, except for Teams social data.
   - Teams social data must be excluded from local storage and handled separately.

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Ensure data consistency between local storage and server sync.
   - Use `dataHash` to verify data integrity.

3. **Security**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data stored locally.
   - Implement access control to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Performance**:
   - Local storage operations must complete within 100ms for 95% of requests.

## Constraints

- IndexedDB must be used as the storage mechanism.
- Data size per user must not exceed 5MB.

## Validation

- Verify that Teams social data is excluded from local storage.
- Test data integrity using `dataHash` during sync.
- Measure performance to ensure compliance with the 100ms target.
