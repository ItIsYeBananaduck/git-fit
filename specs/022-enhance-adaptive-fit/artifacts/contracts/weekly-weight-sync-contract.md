# Contract: Weekly Weight Sync

## Purpose

Define the requirements and constraints for implementing the weekly weight sync feature.

## Requirements

1. **Sync Schedule**:
   - Sync must occur once per week.
   - Use a cron job or equivalent scheduling mechanism.

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Ensure data consistency between local storage and server.
   - Use `dataHash` to verify data integrity.

3. **Security**:
   - Encrypt weight data during transmission.
   - Authenticate requests to the server.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Retry failed syncs up to 3 times.
   - Log errors for debugging and monitoring.

## Constraints

- Sync must complete within 500ms for 95% of requests.
- Weight data size per user must not exceed 1MB.

## Validation

- Verify that sync occurs on schedule.
- Test data integrity using `dataHash` during sync.
- Measure performance to ensure compliance with the 500ms target
