# Tasks: Enhance Adaptive Fit

## Phase 1: Local Storage

1. **Implement IndexedDB for Local Storage**
   - Set up IndexedDB for storing user data locally.
   - Ensure Teams social data is excluded from local storage.

2. **Data Separation**
   - Configure mechanisms to separate local and server data.
   - Test data separation with mock data.

3. **Security Implementation**
   - Encrypt sensitive data stored locally.
   - Implement access control for local storage.

## Phase 2: Weekly Weight Sync

4. **Create Cron Job for Sync**
   - Develop a cron job to schedule weekly weight sync.
   - Test the cron job with mock data.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Implement retry logic for failed syncs (up to 3 retries).
   - Log errors for debugging and monitoring.

6. **Data Integrity Verification**
   - Use `dataHash` to verify data consistency during sync.

## Phase 3: Llama 3.1 Integration

7. **Download Llama 3.1 Model**
   - Implement a script to download the Llama 3.1 model locally.
   - Verify the model is stored in the correct path.

8. **Update AI Engine**
   - Replace GPT-2 with Llama 3.1 in the AI engine.
   - Test the AI engine for performance and accuracy.

## Phase 4: API Testing

9. **Write Integration Tests**
   - Develop integration tests for all APIs.
   - Ensure tests cover edge cases and error scenarios.

10. **Fix Connectivity Issues**
    - Debug and resolve any API connectivity issues.

## Phase 5: Finalization

11. **Performance Optimization**
    - Optimize local storage and sync performance.
    - Ensure compliance with performance targets.

12. **Documentation**
    - Update documentation to reflect the enhanced Adaptive Fit feature.
    - Include a quickstart guide for developers.

13. **Deployment**
    - Finalize and deploy the enhanced Adaptive Fit feature.
    - Monitor for any post-deployment issues.
