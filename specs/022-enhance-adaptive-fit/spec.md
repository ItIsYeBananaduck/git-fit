# Spec: Enhance Adaptive Fit

## Overview

This spec outlines the enhancements to the Adaptive Fit feature, focusing on the following key areas:

1. **Local Storage**: Store all user data locally on devices, except for Teams social data.
2. **Weekly Weight Sync**: Implement a weekly sync of user weights to the server for federated learning.
3. **Llama 3.1 Integration**: Replace the current distilled GPT-2 model with Llama 3.1 from Hugging Face.
4. **API Connectivity**: Ensure all APIs are functional and tested.

## Goals

- Improve user privacy by storing data locally.
- Enable federated learning with minimal server interaction.
- Leverage advanced AI capabilities with Llama 3.1.
- Ensure robust API connectivity and error handling.

## Tasks

### Local Storage

- Implement IndexedDB for offline storage of user data.
- Configure local and server data separation for Teams social.

### Weekly Weight Sync

- Create a cron job for weekly weight sync.
- Test the sync process with mock data.

### Llama 3.1 Integration

- Add the Llama 3.1 model from Hugging Face.
- Update the AI engine to use the new model.
- Implement a script to download the Llama 3.1 model locally for inference tasks.

### API Testing

- Write integration tests for all APIs.
- Fix any connectivity issues.

## Deliverables

- Updated Adaptive Fit feature with local storage and weekly weight sync.
- Integration of Llama 3.1 for federated learning.
- Fully functional and tested APIs.

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Implement local storage and weekly weight sync.
- **Week 2**: Integrate Llama 3.1 and update the AI engine.
- **Week 3**: Conduct API testing and fix issues.
- **Week 4**: Finalize and deploy the enhanced Adaptive Fit feature.

## Validation

- Verify that all user data (except Teams social) is stored locally.
- Ensure weekly weight sync is functional and secure.
- Test Llama 3.1 integration for performance and accuracy.
- Validate API connectivity with integration tests.
