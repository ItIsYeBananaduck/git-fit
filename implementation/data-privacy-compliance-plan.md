## Technical Architecture

### Data Encryption Strategy
```typescript
// Field-level encryption for sensitive data
interface EncryptionConfig {
  healthData: 'AES-256-GCM',      // Separate key per user
  personalInfo: 'AES-256-GCM',    // Shared key, rotated monthly
  workoutData: 'AES-256-GCM',     // Category-based keys
  financialData: 'AES-256-GCM'    // Highest security, HSM-backed
}

// Key management hierarchy
interface KeyManagement {
  masterKey: 'HSM-backed root key',
  categoryKeys: 'Per-data-category encryption keys',
  userKeys: 'Per-user derived keys',
  rotationSchedule: '90 days automated rotation'
}
```

### Consent Management Flow
```typescript
// Granular consent tracking
interface ConsentFlow {
  collection: 'Explicit opt-in for each category',
  withdrawal: 'Immediate effect within 24 hours',
  updates: 'Annual consent refresh required',
  evidence: 'Legal-grade consent records with IP/timestamp'
}
```

### Data Lifecycle Management
```typescript
// Automated retention policies
interface RetentionPolicies {
  healthData: '7 years (HIPAA requirement)',
  workoutData: '5 years then anonymization',
  usageAnalytics: '2 years then aggregation',
  financialData: '7 years (tax compliance)'
}
```
