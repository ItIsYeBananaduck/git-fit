# Data Collection & Storage Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details for data collection and storage, focusing on logging set-level data and managing retention policies.

## Features

### 1. Set-Level Data Logging
- **Data Points**:
  - Reps, load, heart rate (HR) start/end, recovery time.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create data models for set-level logging in Convex.
  2. Build APIs to log data in real-time during workouts.
  3. Implement validation to ensure data accuracy.

### 2. Retention Policies
- **Policies**:
  - Retain raw data for short-term analysis.
  - Summarize data for long-term storage.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Define retention rules for raw and summarized data.
  2. Implement automated data summarization processes.
  3. Build tools for manual data export and deletion.

### 3. Data Privacy and Security
- **Features**:
  - Encrypt sensitive user data.
  - Ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Implement encryption for all stored data.
  2. Regularly audit data storage for compliance.
  3. Provide users with tools to manage their data.
