## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical UI Components (High Priority)
Focus on user-facing functionality that impacts core user experience.

#### ✅ COMPLETED: Dashboard UI Tests

- **Analysis Required:**
  - Read payments functions in convex
  - Understand commission calculation logic
  - Map Stripe Connect integration
- **Implementation Scope:**
  - Commission calculation with edge cases
  - Stripe Connect account creation (mocked)
  - Payment processing error handling
  - Business rule validation

#### ⏳ PENDING: Exercises Backend Tests  
- **File:** `/workspaces/git-fit/app/convex/__tests__/exercises.test.ts`
- **Analysis Required:**
  - Read exercises functions in convex
  - Understand importExercises logic
  - Map equipment recommendation algorithms
- **Implementation Scope:**
  - ImportExercises without duplicates
  - Equipment recommendations logic
  - Database interaction mocking
  - Data validation scenarios

### Phase 3: Supporting Components (Medium Priority)
Admin and support functionality important for system management.

#### ⏳ PENDING: SupportTicketManager Component Tests
- **File:** `/workspaces/git-fit/app/src/lib/components/admin/__tests__/SupportTicketManager.test.ts`
- **Analysis Required:**
  - Read SupportTicketManager component
  - Identify props and event handling
  - Map UI interaction patterns
- **Implementation Scope:**
  - Component structure validation
  - Props and events testing
  - Ticket filtering logic
  - UI state management

### Phase 4: Basic Test Enhancement (Low Priority)
Foundation tests that establish development patterns.

#### ⏳ PENDING: Demo and Page Specs Enhancement
- **Files:** 
  - `/workspaces/git-fit/app/src/demo.spec.ts`
  - `/workspaces/git-fit/app/src/routes/page.svelte.spec.ts`
- **Implementation Scope:**
  - Replace trivial math tests with meaningful functionality
  - Expand page tests beyond basic h1 validation
  - Establish component testing patterns

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Testing Stack
- **Framework:** Vitest with browser mode
- **Rendering:** `vitest-browser-svelte` for component testing
- **Mocking:** Vitest mocking system for dependencies
- **Assertions:** Extended matchers for DOM testing

### Mocking Strategy
- **Convex API:** Mock all database queries and mutations
- **External APIs:** Mock Stripe, payment processors
- **Browser APIs:** Mock download functionality, localStorage
- **Svelte Stores:** Mock authentication and state management

### Test Patterns
1. **Component Tests:** Mount, interact, assert
2. **Integration Tests:** Mock dependencies, test workflows  
3. **Error Handling:** Test edge cases and failure scenarios
4. **Async Testing:** Proper handling of promises and loading states
