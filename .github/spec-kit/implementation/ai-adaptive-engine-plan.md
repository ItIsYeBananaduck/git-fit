# AI & Adaptive Engine Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the actionable steps to implement the AI & Adaptive Engine based on the provided specifications.

## Tasks

### Dynamic Adjustments

1. Develop algorithms for dynamic adjustment calculations.
2. Integrate HR data processing from wearable devices.
3. Store adjustment history in Convex for analysis.

### Auto-Calibration for RIR

1. Build a machine learning model for RIR prediction.
2. Train the model using first-week calibration data.
3. Implement real-time RIR adjustments during workouts.

### Fatigue-Aware Modeling

1. Build fatigue monitoring algorithms.
2. Integrate HRV and strain data from wearables.
3. Create user notifications for fatigue-related adjustments.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Convex for data storage and processing.
- **Wearable Integration**: APIs for HR and HRV data.
- **Machine Learning**: Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch for RIR prediction.
- **Frontend**: Svelte for user notifications.

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Dynamic Adjustments (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Auto-Calibration for RIR (2 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Fatigue-Aware Modeling (2 weeks)
