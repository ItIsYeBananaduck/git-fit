## Nutrition AI – Auto Macro Adjustment on Plateau

- [x] Detect plateau from `monthlySummary`: - No change in average/max volume or load for 3+ weeks - Weight has not changed in 3+ weeks (if goal is weight-based)
- [x] Confirm user is **compliant** (logs/workouts consistent)
- [x] Adjust macros carefully: - Bulk: +5–10% carbs or protein - Cut: -5–10% carbs or fats - Recomp: micro-adjust around training window
- [x] Update `nutritionConfig.currentMacros` and push to `macroHistory[]`
- [x] Generate adjustment note (example):

```json
{
  "reason": "3-week strength plateau with full workout compliance",
  "adjustment": {
    "calories": "+150 kcal",
    "carbs": "+35g"
  }
}
```

Prioritize safe calorie levels — never drop below clinical minimums.

Include config toggle: "autoAdjustMacros": true

Send notification: "We adjusted your macros to help you break through your plateau. You can view or revert this change in your settings."

Disable auto-adjust if wearable or weight log is unavailable for over 14 days.
