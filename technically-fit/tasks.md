# Implementation Tasks for Technically Fit

This document breaks down the actionable tasks needed to implement the missing specs and features identified in your project.

---

## Nutrition AI

- [x] Implement recovery-aware micro-adjustments (HRV, resting HR, sleep integration)
- [x] Add hydration recommendations based on recovery metrics
- [x] Create make-up logic for missed protein targets
- [x] Add safety rails for health flags (diabetes/heart history logic)
- [x] Enforce trainer data sharing for tailored plans
- [ ] Integrate payments & distribution logic (Apple fee strategy, web checkout, PWA fallback)
- [ ] Implement IP & secrecy protections (API hardening, device attestation, secrets management)
- [ ] Add model governance (versioned models, canary rollout)
- [ ] Implement telemetry logging (decision outcomes, anonymized inputs)

## AI Adaptive Engine

- [x] Build dynamic adjustment algorithms for sets/reps/load based on feedback and HR data
- [x] Implement auto-calibration for RIR (machine learning model, training, real-time adjustment)
- [x] Add fatigue-aware modeling (HRV/strain integration, fatigue warnings)
- [x] Create user notifications for fatigue-related adjustments
- [x] Integrate daily strain assessment using SpO₂ and resting heart rate (traffic light zones, training adjustments, health alerts)

## Wearable & Device Support

- [x] Develop APIs for device data synchronization (Apple Watch, WHOOP, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit)
- [x] Implement device connection management with auto-reconnect
- [x] Build real-time data collection pipelines for wearable metrics
- [x] Create widgets for quick access (iOS/Android)

### Wearable Workout UI

- [x] Build simplified in-workout UI for wearables (Apple Watch + Android watches)
  - Implement pre-set screen with rep/volume adjustment controls
  - Create in-set screen showing live HR, SpO₂, and strain indicator
  - Add 3 feedback buttons (Set Completed, Too Easy, Too Hard) - **Note: These buttons already exist on mobile, need to port to wearable**
  - Design optional post-set transition summary
- [ ] Implement Apple Watch complications
  - Add readiness score complication (0-100 or emoji)
  - Add baseline resting HR complication (30-day average)
  - Add baseline SpO₂ complication (color-coded)
  - Support Modular, Corner, and Graphic Circular layouts
- [ ] Develop platform-specific implementations
  - Apple Watch: Use HKLiveWorkoutBuilder, SwiftUI, CLKComplicationTemplate
  - Android Wear OS: Use Jetpack Compose, Health Services API
  - Support digital crown/scroll gestures for adjustments
- [ ] Integrate strain logic with workout feedback
  - Connect wearable feedback buttons to existing mobile adaptive AI algorithm
  - Update strain calculations based on real-time metrics
  - Implement haptic feedback for transitions

## Data Collection & Storage

- [x] Add retention policies (raw vs. summarized data)
- [x] Implement automated data summarization
- [x] Build manual data export/deletion tools
- [x] Add data encryption and privacy compliance
- [x] Create user data management tools

## User Onboarding

- [ ] Add medical screening questionnaire (injury/condition tracking)
- [ ] Build goal identification interface (primary/secondary objectives)
- [ ] Implement recommendation engine for training splits
- [ ] Create split comparison interface and educational content

## User Experience Enhancement

- [ ] Redesign unified navigation and design language across modules
- [ ] Add achievement badges and milestone celebrations
- [ ] Implement adaptive recommendations based on user behavior
- [ ] Build customizable dashboards for key metrics
- [ ] Ensure accessibility for users with disabilities
