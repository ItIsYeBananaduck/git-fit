# Nutrition Tracking Requirements

## Introduction

The Technically Fit platform requires a comprehensive nutrition tracking system that enables users to log their food intake, scan barcodes for easy food entry, track macronutrients and calories, and integrate with their fitness goals. The system will use Open Food Facts API for barcode scanning and USDA FoodData Central for accurate nutrition data, providing users with detailed insights into their dietary habits and helping trainers provide better nutritional guidance.
