7. WHEN recovery patterns emerge from device data THEN the system SHALL learn individual recovery characteristics for better weekly programming

### Requirement 7: First Week Adjustment Period and RIR Learning

**User Story:** As a new user starting my program, I want the first week to be an intensive learning period where the system calibrates my capabilities and learns to predict my Reps in Reserve (RIR), so that future workouts are precisely tailored to my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria
