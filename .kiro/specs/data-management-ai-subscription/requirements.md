# Data Management & AI Subscription System Requirements

## Introduction

The Technically Fit platform requires an intelligent data management system that keeps the database lean by retaining only essential AI training data while compressing or deleting non-critical historical data. Additionally, the advanced AI training features will be part of a premium subscription tier, requiring a subscription management system that controls access to AI-powered training adaptations, RIR predictions, and device-based program adjustments.

2. WHEN users request historical data THEN the system SHALL provide available summary data and explain what was compressed
3. WHEN data recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL restore archived data within reasonable time limits
4. WHEN users export their data THEN the system SHALL include both current and archived information
5. WHEN legal or compliance requirements exist THEN the system SHALL retain necessary data regardless of normal retention policies
6. WHEN users delete accounts THEN the system SHALL provide options for data export before permanent deletion
7. WHEN data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL have backup and recovery procedures for critical AI training data

### Requirement 6: Premium AI Feature Set Definition
