# Authentication System Requirements

## Introduction

The Technically Fit platform requires a comprehensive authentication system that supports multiple user roles (clients, trainers, and admins) with secure registration, login, and profile management capabilities. The system must integrate with the existing Convex backend and support role-based access control throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Registration

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account with my email and choose my role (client or trainer), so that I can access the appropriate features of the Technically Fit platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display a form with email, password, name, and role selection fields
2. WHEN a user selects "client" role THEN the system SHALL show additional fields for fitness level, goals, height, weight, and date of birth
3. WHEN a user selects "trainer" role THEN the system SHALL show additional fields for certifications, specialties, bio, and hourly rate
4. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account in Convex
5. WHEN a user submits invalid data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors
6. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically log the user in and redirect to their dashboard
7. WHEN a user tries to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 2: User Login

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to log into my account using my email and password, so that I can access my personalized dashboard and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display email and password input fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to their role-appropriate dashboard
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store their session securely
5. WHEN a user clicks "Remember Me" THEN the system SHALL extend their session duration
6. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" THEN the system SHALL initiate a password reset flow

### Requirement 3: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a user with a specific role, I want to see only the features and pages relevant to my role, so that I have a focused and appropriate experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client logs in THEN the system SHALL show client-specific navigation items (Dashboard, Marketplace, Programs, Workouts, Fitness Data, AI Training, Profile)
2. WHEN a trainer logs in THEN the system SHALL show trainer-specific navigation items (Dashboard, Marketplace, Programs, Create Program, My Clients, Profile)
3. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL show admin-specific navigation items (Dashboard, Admin, all other features)
4. WHEN a user tries to access a page not allowed for their role THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an unauthorized page or their dashboard
5. WHEN the system renders components THEN it SHALL only show features appropriate for the current user's role

### Requirement 4: Session Management

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to be maintained securely across page refreshes and browser sessions, so that I don't have to repeatedly log in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session token
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL maintain their logged-in state
3. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser THEN the system SHALL remember their session if "Remember Me" was selected
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to the login page
6. WHEN a user is inactive for 24 hours THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out

### Requirement 5: Profile Management

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to view and update my profile information, so that I can keep my account details current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits their profile page THEN the system SHALL display their current profile information
2. WHEN a user updates their profile information THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes to Convex
3. WHEN a trainer updates their hourly rate THEN the system SHALL update their marketplace listing
4. WHEN a user uploads a profile image THEN the system SHALL store it securely and update their profile
5. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL require their current password for verification
6. WHEN profile updates are successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message
7. WHEN profile updates fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 6: Password Reset

**User Story:** As a user who forgot their password, I want to reset it using my email address, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" THEN the system SHALL display a password reset form
2. WHEN a user enters their email address THEN the system SHALL send a password reset link to that email
3. WHEN a user clicks the reset link THEN the system SHALL display a new password form
4. WHEN a user sets a new password THEN the system SHALL update their account and log them in
5. WHEN a reset link is older than 1 hour THEN the system SHALL consider it expired and require a new reset
6. WHEN an invalid email is entered THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message without revealing if the email exists

### Requirement 7: Account Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want my account to be secure with proper password requirements and protection against unauthorized access, so that my personal information remains safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a password THEN the system SHALL require at least 8 characters with mixed case, numbers, and special characters
2. WHEN a user attempts to log in with wrong credentials 5 times THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock their account
3. WHEN suspicious login activity is detected THEN the system SHALL require additional verification
4. WHEN a user logs in from a new device THEN the system SHALL optionally send an email notification
5. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
6. WHEN passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL hash them using secure algorithms

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to integrate seamlessly with the existing Convex backend and UI components, so that user data flows correctly throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL use the existing Convex user schema and functions
2. WHEN user state changes THEN the Navigation component SHALL update to reflect the current user's role and information
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers
4. WHEN a user's role is checked THEN the system SHALL use the role stored in the Convex users table
5. WHEN user profile data is needed THEN the system SHALL fetch it from the existing Convex user functions
6. WHEN the authentication state changes THEN all components SHALL reactively update to reflect the new state
